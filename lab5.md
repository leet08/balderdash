I used Google PageSpeed Insights to test my Heroku app. The general results showed that my pages load very quickly, within 1 second, because there is very little content at this point. Some opportunities it cited to increase page speed were to use images in nex-gen formats and other JavaScript improvements for image rendering efficiency. It also suggested a long cache lifetime for speeding up repeat visits. This is due to my background image being pulled directly from another website.

The SEO report through Seobility generally described my site as fast with good structure but little content or links. I hadn't included a meta description, which would be useful if I wanted the app to be viewable through Google search. It also suggested enabling compressed HTML content transfer and utilizing social networks in the site. I would also want to update the page title to something more relevant and include a description of the site both in the meta description and at the top of the index page using SEO keywords. As it's just an example generic message board there aren't a whole lot of keywords that are useful for now but if the site were specifically designed for instance mountain hiking (given the background image) I could include a number of keywords revolving around mountain locations, trails, hiking gear, vendors, etc.
